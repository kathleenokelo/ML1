## README: Machine Learning Basics

### Introduction

This guide is designed to help you get hands-on practice with foundational concepts in ML using the chip dataset.
#### Semiconductor Data
#### Objectives

You will practice your data cleaning skills on the main data (not the summarized version) by perfoming the following tasks: 
1. Explore the missingness in the dataset for categorical and numerical data

2. Develop a strategy to deal with the missing values, i.e deletion, imputation by mean or mode etc, whilst providing rationale for your approach.
   
3. Drop non-consequntial fields

4. Transform temporal data to their corrrect format (date time)
 
5. Perfom a full EDA and demonstrate the validity of the following assumptions
   
> - Moore's Law still holds, especially in GPUs.
> - Dannard Scaling is still valid in general.
> - CPUs have higher frequencies, but GPUs are catching up.
> - GPU performance doubles every 1.5 years.
> - GPU performance improvement is a joint effect of smaller transistors, larger die size, and higher frequency.
> - High-end GPUs tends to first use new semiconductor technologies. Low-end GPUs may use old technologies for a few years.
> - Process Size for Intel, AMD and Nvidia lies in comparatively lower range than for ATI and other vemdors
> - TSMC makes the highest number of chips in the world

6. Calculate and visualized the correlation among the features
   
7. Perfom the correct encoding for your data, in readiness for modelling.
