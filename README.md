## README: Machine Learning Basics

### Introduction

This guide is designed to help you get hands-on practice with foundational concepts in ML. Whether you're new to the field or looking to solidify your understanding, the exercises outlined here will provide a comprehensive introduction to key topics.

### Exercises

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - **Objective**: Learn how to handle missing data, outliers, and data types.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Use `pandas` to identify and fill missing values in a dataset.
     - Practice data type conversion and understand the importance of data normalization.
     - Remove or replace outliers based on statistical methods.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - **Objective**: Create meaningful features from raw data to improve model performance.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Generate polynomial features and understand their impact on model complexity.
     - Implement feature scaling techniques such as Min-Max Scaling and Standardization.
     - Work on categorical data encoding using methods like One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   - **Objective**: Train simple models and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Fit a linear regression model using `scikit-learn`.
     - Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
     - Perform cross-validation to assess model stability.

4. **Residual Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Understand residuals and their importance in model diagnostics.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Plot residuals to check for patterns that might indicate model issues.
     - Perform the Durbin-Watson test to check for autocorrelation in residuals.
     - Analyze heteroscedasticity and understand its implications for model reliability.

5. **Model Selection**
   - **Objective**: Learn how to select the best model using techniques such as Cross-Validation.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Compare the performance of different models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and SVM.
     - Use cross-validation to ensure that the selected model generalizes well to new data.

6. **Polynomial Regression**
   - **Objective**: Explore non-linear relationships in data using polynomial regression.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Generate polynomial features and train a polynomial regression model.
     - Compare the performance of polynomial regression with linear regression.
     - Understand the risk of overfitting with high-degree polynomials.

7. **Handling Real-World Data**
   - **Objective**: Apply your skills to real-world datasets.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Work with datasets from domains such as finance, healthcare, or e-commerce.
     - Practice cleaning and preprocessing large datasets with missing or noisy data.
     - Train and evaluate models on real-world tasks like price prediction or customer segmentation.
